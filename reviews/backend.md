# JavaScript Style

- Good JS style in backend code
- Good use of seed file
- Remove things.js

# Database

### Validations

+ No current validations in the data model

### Schema Design

- Category should not have a list of all products, as that list grows, becomes unwieldy to manage it as an embedded document
- Order looks good, however, doesn't handle Line Item capability (quantity, product and price).
    - Total should probably be a virtual/calculated field rather than a stored field
- Product model looks good, description blurb can be calculated to automatically strip the actual description virtually rather than in the model itself having to store both
    + No validations
    + No need to store an array of Reviews, can look it up as necessary

- Reviews look good

# Node.js

### Routes

- Appear to be using standard routing generated by endpoint
- No authentication yet, what are plans for locking down Admin versus regular views?

### Controllers

- Appears standard generated.

### Middleware
